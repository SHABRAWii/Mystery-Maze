## Executive Summary

------------


This document presents the design and implementation of a Maze Solving Application with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Python's tkinter library. The application features two windows: the first window offers initial choices of "Go" and "Exit," while the second window provides more extensive options, including "Next Map," "A* Algorithm," "DFS Algorithm," "Dijkstra Algorithm," "Get Statistics," and "Exit." This application highlights the integration of AI algorithms and a user-friendly interface, facilitating maze exploration and algorithm selection.
## Introduction:

------------


Mazes are classic problems in computer science, serving as an excellent platform to test AI algorithms. The Maze Solving Application employs tkinter, a widely-used GUI toolkit in Python, to create an interactive and visually appealing environment.
## Objectives:

------------


- Develop a maze-solving application with a user-friendly tkinter interface.
- Implement various AI algorithms for maze solving.
- Provide users with options to navigate through mazes and analyze algorithmic choices.
- Present statistics related to algorithm performance.




## Application Features:

------------




### 1. First Window 

The initial window presents users with two choices:
- Go:
Proceed to the second window for additional options.

- Exit: 
Close the application.




### 2. Second Window

###### 1. Next Map:
 This option generates a new random maze, providing users with diverse scenarios for testing algorithms.
###### 2. A* Algorithm:
Utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path through the maze, combining heuristic and cost functions.
###### 3. DFS Algorithm:
Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm, exploring paths deeply before backtracking.
###### 4. Dijkstra Algorithm:
Employs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path by evaluating all possible paths in a weighted maze.
###### 5. Get Statistics:
 Generates and displays performance metrics, including algorithm execution time, path length, and resource utilization.
###### 6.  Exit:
Closes the application.
##  Implementation
#### 1. Language and Libraries
- The application is developed in Python, leveraging the tkinter library for GUI development.
#### 2. Code Structure
- The code follows a modular structure, promoting readability and maintainability. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate module to facilitate future enhancements.
#### 3. User Interface Design
- The GUI is designed for simplicity and clarity, providing users with an intuitive experience. Proper labeling and informative messages guide users through the application.
## Conclusion
- The Maze Solving Application with Python GUI using tkinter offers a practical and engaging platform for exploring AI algorithms in maze-solving scenarios. The combination of a user-friendly interface and diverse algorithmic choices enhances the user experience, making it an excellent tool for educational and experimental purposes. This project serves as an exemplar for integrating AI algorithms into real-world applications with a focus on user interaction.
